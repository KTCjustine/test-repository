                <br><br>
                As I'll explain in a moment, that reason has everything to do with one bizarre hormone that programs carbs to be stored as fat -- virtually from the moment food touches your lips.

                    He’d had a ton of success helping women shed the fat --

                    Dr. Sterling’s talk was impressive... <br><br>
                    <b>But as the talk went on, she realized that the doctor wasn’t going to

                    So right at the end…<br><br>
                    When participants were asked if they had any questions for the doctor…<br><br>
                    She unmuted her microphone and blurted out…

                <u>But it makes it virtually impossible to lose any of your excess weight.</u> <br><br>

                Your arms pack on another layer of fat…<br><br>
                Your tummy grows another inch….<br><br>

                        The first reason for your low amylase levels is wheat…<br><br>
                        <b>Studies have shown that wheat is an “inhibitor” of the amylase enzyme…</b><br><br>
                        And given that wheat is in bread… pasta… muffins… cereals… baked goods… even alcohol…<br><br>
                        <u>It can be almost impossible to stop your amylase levels from taking a nosedive.</u><br><br>
                        Yet we all know people who eat lots of wheat and stay slim… so what gives?<br><br>
                        The truth is, a handful of people can eat wheat and keep their amylase levels normal.<br><br>
                        However… <br><br>
                        There’s one cause of an amylase malfunction you can’t avoid…<br><br>
                        This unavoidable reason is carrying excess weight (especially year after year).<br>

                    Then your problems will continue, month after month… <br><br>
                    Which is why the doctor told me about a special process he uses… <br><br>
                    <b>That is proven to <span id="underline4">increase absorption of nutrients by 168%.</span></b>

            <p>
                “How do you do that?” I asked him. <br><br>
                First, you need to source the highest quality version of this “living nutrient”…<br><br>
                Which means ensuring your supply of the “living nutrient” is kept at the right temperature, not
                exposed to any contamination and is ultra-potent.<br><br>
                Then you need to mix it with an “encapsulating” edible gelatin…<br><br>
                This part is REALLY important, because you have to mix them together in a precise ratio…<br><br>
                In order for the “living nutrient” to be protected from your stomach acid and to be released in
                your gut.<br><br>
                Next, you have to stir it right… heat it right… and cool it right…<br><br>
                And that’s how you end up with the Beach Ready Bites!<br><br>
                Of course, if this sounds complex…<br><br>
                <b>That’s because it is.</b><br><br>
                In fact, the doctor said that it is incredibly difficult to
                produce enough <br>of the Beach Ready Bites for just the patients at his clinics.<br><br>
                Which was a problem…

                    if the doctor was already having a hard time keeping up with demand?<br><br>
                    Well, after much back and forth…<br><br>
                    We decided to team up with the only manufacturer in America

                        The Beach Ready Bites are based on a Harvard and Stanford
                        discovery, that determined the true cause of weight gain to
                        be low amylase levels. <br><br>
                        When your amylase levels malfunction (and plunge),
                        insulin levels skyrocket.<br><br>
                        In short, this programs every food you eat to stored as clingy fat.<br><br>
                        And that’s where Dr. Sterling’s Beach Ready Bites breakthrough comes in!

                    So each chew of your food now burns off fat without special diets or crazy exercise.
